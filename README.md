- **Introduction**:
  - Let me give you a quick overview of using this app for Calling Campaigns. Briefly speaking, this is a Python based command line application that uses the Pandas library and a lot of personalized object oriented interface code so that it works with almost all kinds of excel files generated by Slate queries. The main purpose of this application is to:
    - Automate filtering through Excel Files
    - Split and Combine Excel Files together
    - Be a better tool for assisting the GAs in Calling Campaigns
    - And optimize the Calling Campaign process at the Office of Graduate Admissions to reduce manual data handling tasks.
  - The ‘behind the scenes’ part of the application consists of 5 feature programs that are independent of each other and serve their own purpose. The five feature programs in the application are:
    - International Student Data Filters
    - Domestic Student Data Filters
    - Split Excel Data File
    - Combine Excel Files
    - Calling Campaign Assist for GAs
  - I will walk you through each of the feature programs along with some application snapshots to help you use the application effectively.
